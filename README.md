# Chipbot Pylons Clone

Welcome to Chipbot Pylons Clone! 

This is a simple video widget that can be easily added to your website. It allows you to embed a video from YouTube or Vimeo directly onto your site with just a few lines of code. 

To get started, simply copy and paste the provided code into the HTML of your website. You can then customize the appearance of the widget by modifying the CSS styles. 

Some features of this widget include: 
- Responsive design that adjusts to the size of the viewer's screen 
- Automatic looping of the video 
- Ability to mute the audio 

Future Plans:
- We plan on adding support for more video platforms in the future, such as DailyMotion and Hulu. 
- We also plan on implementing options for customizing the video controls, such as the play/pause button and progress bar.
